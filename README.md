# Text Classification (NLP & A.I) 

Text can be an extremely rich source of information, but extracting insights from it can be hard and time-consuming, due to its unstructured nature.
But, thanks to advances in natural language processing and machine learning, which both fall under the vast umbrella of artificial intelligence, 
sorting text data is getting easier.

We worked on IMDB movie reviews Dataset, and we've used natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques, and we 've build a model to classify them between positive and negative
reviews.
